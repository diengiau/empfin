# Set up your research platforms

When doing research in empirical finance, the first question you need to answer is which programming language you should choose. In empirical finance, some common languages are: Stata, Eviews, SAS, R, Python, Matlab.

We can divide them into two groups:

1. Like-programing language: R, SAS
2. Not-too-like-programming language: Stata, Eviews
3. Really-programming language: Python, Matlab, and R (to some extent)

When I choose a programming language, I often consider these criteria:

1. Fee: open-source (R and Python) and paid programs (Matlab, SAS, etc.).
2. Documents: Paid programs have better documents (for sure), but open-source programs are better and better readability now.
3. Expandability: Does the language allows you to do machine learning or Bayesian statistics?
4. Iteration capacity: Do you feel tired when you run 1,000 times of bootstrap? How long does it take to run regressions for each firm and report the $R^2$ for each regression?
5. Active community: How long does it take to receive an answer after you ask something in their community? I will refuse a language if it takes me more than 6 months.
